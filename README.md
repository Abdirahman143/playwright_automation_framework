# Playwright Automation Framework

This repository contains an automation framework for UI and API testing using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Features

- **UI Testing**: Automate browser interactions and validate UI behaviors across multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
- **API Testing**: Perform RESTful API testing with Playwright's built-in `request` methods.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Supports testing in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Jest for Test Running**: Uses Jest for running tests with flexible assertion libraries.
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety using TypeScript.
